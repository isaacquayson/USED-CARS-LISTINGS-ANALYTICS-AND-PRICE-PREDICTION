# USED-CARS-LISTINGS-ANALYTICS-AND-PRICE-PREDICTION

## üìë Abstract

The used car market plays a critical role in providing affordable mobility solutions, yet determining fair prices remains a challenge due to the many influencing factors such as brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and condition. This project applies a **data-driven approach** to analyze and predict used car prices.

Data cleaning and preparation were performed using **Excel Power Query**, while **Power BI** was used to build an **interactive dashboard** that visualizes key insights such as car conditions, mileage trends, fuel preferences, yearly price trends, and geographical distributions. In addition, a **machine learning regression model** was developed in **Python** to predict car prices. Among the tested models, **Random Forest** achieved the best performance with an **R¬≤ score of 0.83** and an **RMSE of ~2069**, outperforming Linear Regression.

By combining **descriptive analytics** through dashboarding and **predictive modeling** through machine learning, this project provides actionable insights and accurate price predictions to support decision-making for stakeholders in the used car ecosystem.

## üìñ Introduction  

The automobile industry has witnessed a massive increase in the demand for used cars as consumers seek affordable alternatives to brand-new vehicles. With multiple factors such as **make, model, mileage, year, fuel type, condition, and seller type** influencing car prices, estimating the fair market value becomes a complex process. Buyers often risk overpaying, while sellers struggle to set competitive yet profitable prices.  

To address this challenge, this project integrates **data cleaning, visualization, and machine learning** to analyze trends and predict used car prices. The combination of **Excel Power Query**, **Power BI dashboards**, and **Python regression models** ensures both clarity in understanding the data and accuracy in price forecasting.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement  

Determining accurate used car prices is often difficult due to:  
- Variability in features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission, and condition.  
- The lack of transparency in price determinants across different sellers and regions.  
- Limited ability to derive actionable insights from large datasets without advanced tools.  

This makes it challenging for stakeholders‚Äîbuyers, sellers, and dealerships‚Äîto make **data-driven decisions** regarding pricing and purchasing strategies.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology  

The project followed a step-by-step data analytics and machine learning workflow:  

1. **Data Collection & Import**  
   - A dataset containing used car listings with attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, price, fuel type, transmission, and condition was imported into Excel and Python.  

2. **Data Cleaning (Excel Power Query)**  
   - Removed duplicates.  
   - Checked for missing/null values and ensured consistent formatting.  
   - Verified data types for all variables.  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Power BI & Python)**  
   - Built visualizations to understand mileage distribution, pricing trends, and categorical feature influences.  
   - Created an **interactive dashboard in Power BI** to allow dynamic exploration of car listings.  

4. **Feature Encoding (Python)**  
   - Converted categorical variables (e.g., make, fuel type, transmission) into numeric form using **Label Encoding** for model compatibility.  

5. **Model Development (Python)**  
   - Defined independent variables (`make`, `model`, `year`, `mileage`, `condition`, etc.) and dependent variable (`price`).  
   - Split data into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets.  
   - Trained two models:  
     - **Linear Regression**  
     - **Random Forest Regressor**  

6. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Compared models using **R¬≤ Score** and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.  
   - Linear Regression: R¬≤ = 0.65, RMSE ‚âà 2960.  
   - Random Forest: R¬≤ = 0.83, RMSE ‚âà 2069 (best performing model).  

7. **Insights & Reporting**  
   - Summarized findings into actionable insights.  
   - Combined Power BI dashboard with predictive modeling results for comprehensive analysis.

## üìä Actionable Insights  

From the data analysis and predictive modeling, the following key insights were derived:  

1. **Mileage has a strong negative correlation with price** ‚Äì cars with higher mileage tend to have significantly lower resale values.  
2. **Car make and model are major determinants of price** ‚Äì premium brands (e.g., Mercedes-Benz, BMW) consistently have higher price ranges compared to economy brands (e.g., Hyundai, Kia).  
3. **Fuel type influences pricing trends** ‚Äì hybrid and electric cars generally attract higher market values compared to petrol or diesel cars.  
4. **Vehicle condition directly impacts resale value** ‚Äì well-maintained cars in good condition are priced substantially higher than those marked as fair or poor.  
5. **The Random Forest Regressor provides more reliable predictions** than Linear Regression, capturing complex relationships between features and price with higher accuracy.

## üí° Recommendations  

Based on the findings, the following recommendations are proposed:  

1. **For Buyers:**  
   - Compare listings based on mileage, fuel type, and condition to ensure fair pricing.  
   - Use the dashboard insights to identify undervalued options among specific brands and models.  

2. **For Sellers:**  
   - Highlight vehicle condition, service history, and fuel efficiency in listings to justify higher prices.  
   - Consider market demand patterns (e.g., growing preference for hybrid/electric vehicles) when setting prices.  

3. **For Dealerships & Platforms:**  
   - Integrate predictive models like Random Forest to provide **automated price suggestions** for listings.  
   - Use dashboards to monitor trends and adjust marketing strategies accordingly.
